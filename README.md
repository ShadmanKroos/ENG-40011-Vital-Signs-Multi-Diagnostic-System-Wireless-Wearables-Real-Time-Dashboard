# ENG-40011-Vital-Signs-Multi-Diagnostic-System-Wireless-Wearables-Real-Time-Dashboard

The Vital-Signs Multi-Diagnostic System is a proof-of-concept prototype designed to improve time efficiency in emergency room diagnostics by automating three routine measurements: temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. The system consists of two wireless devices and a software dashboard that displays real-time patient data. Device 1 is a wrist-worn unit that combines a pulse oximeter and pressure sensing to capture heart rate and blood pressure, and Device 2 is an earpiece thermometer using an infrared sensing approach for temperature measurement. Data is transmitted wirelessly using ESP8266, then processed and displayed through a dashboard that includes color-coded visual indicators and timeline graphs to support real-time monitoring and trend tracking. 


The project focuses on reducing nurse workload associated with repeated manual vital checks. Testing showed an average setup time of 33.32 seconds (boot to first transmission) and an average data reading and display time of 10.7 seconds, indicating a significant improvement compared to traditional procedures and suggesting potential time savings of over 4 hours per nurse per week. Prototype testing also assessed interference and transmission integrity (no observed cross-talk), power performance (3 hours 47 minutes runtime at ~290 mA), basic safety (no detected current outside insulation and no overheating), and wearability/durability during use. The report concludes that while the prototype demonstrates strong potential for improving workflow efficiency and usability, further refinement is required to improve sensor reliability and align the system with relevant medical device and privacy standards for real clinical deployment.
